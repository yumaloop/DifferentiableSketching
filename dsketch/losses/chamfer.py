class Chamfer(_Loss):
    """Compute the chamfer loss between points, line segments, curves, etc.

    This chamfer distance implementation is designed to be flexible and can work with arbitrary data (as long as it can
    be represented as a tensor). The approach is as follows:
        1. the squared total distance transform is computed by applying the provided `dt2_fcn` to the input tensor.
        2. the total distance transform is computed by square-rooting the squared total distance transform.
        3. the target mask image is computed by applying the `ras_fcn` to the target tensor.
        4. the chamfer tensor is computed by computing the hadamard product of the total distance transform and target
           mask.
        5. the chamfer tensor is reduced using the specified reduction.

    Examples:
        - if the input represented line segments, then the `dt2_fcn` would need to compute the total (min across each
          segment) squared distance transform.
        - if the target represented line segments, then the `ras_fcn` would need to compute a binary raster of those
          segments (need not be differentiable)
        - if the target represented a binary target image, then the `ras_fcn` would just be None.

    Args:
        dt2_fcn: function to transform input into a batch of squared distance transform images
        ras_fcn: function to transform target into a batch of rasters; can be None if target is already a batch of
          rasters

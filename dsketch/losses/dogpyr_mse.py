class DoGPyramidMSE(_Loss):
    """Mean Squared Error loss over a Difference of Gaussian scale space or pyramid.

    This loss function is basically mean-squared error applied to scale-space difference-of-gaussian representations of
    the target and input images. The representation can by a pure scale space (no downsampling) or pyramidal
    (downsampling very octave).

    Intuitively this loss should favor reconstructions that capture the broad structure of the target (strong edges for
    example).

    Args:
        channels: Number of channels of the input tensors. Output will have this number of channels as well.
        octaves: Number of octaves in the pyramid. Each octave represents a doubling of sigma.
        intervals: Number of intervals to break each octave into
        init_sigma: Standard deviation blurring of the input images. Default of 0.5 is the minimum that would be
            possible without aliasing
        dim: number of dimensions for the (difference of) gaussian
        downsample: if true then each octave is subsampled by taking every other pixel
        weight: if False, then each scale is weighted according to its size when computing the mean; if true then each
            time downsampling is used, the means of those downsampled layers is multiplied by 4^s before summation so
            that the number of pixels is equal in each scale. Can also be a tensor or sequence of length
            octaves*intervals+1 to specify a particular weight for each corresponding scale. Has no effect if reduction
            is 'none'.
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, *)` where :math:`*` means dim number of additional dimensions
        - Target: :math:`(N, C, *)` where :math:`*` means dim number of additional dimensions
